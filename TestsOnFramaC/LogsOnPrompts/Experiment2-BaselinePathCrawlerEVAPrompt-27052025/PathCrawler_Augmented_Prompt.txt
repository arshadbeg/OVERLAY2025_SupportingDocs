GOALS :
1. Describe any abstract properties of the input program
that could be represented as ACSL annotations
2. Analyze the pathcrawler CSV and describe any patterns
that you see that could help you understand the
behaviors of the program based on given input / output
pairs
3. Describe how these behaviors could be used into
creating ACSL annotations
4. Generate ACSL annotations based on your analysis of
the program and take special account of the properties
described when analyzing the Pathcrawler CSV file
5. Returning a program with no annotation is not a valid
solution
6. Do not edit the C code , only add annotations
7. Make sure to describe your thought process behind the
annotations
8. Do not skip any code in the returned solution to make
it shorter .
9. If you break any of these rules then my family will
disown me .
