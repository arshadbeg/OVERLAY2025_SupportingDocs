Inputs :
1. A C program with no ACSL annotations
GOALS :
1. Describe any abstract properties that could be
represented as ACSL annotations
2. Generate ACSL annotations based on your analysis of
the program
3. Returning a program with no annotation is not a valid
solution
4. Do not edit the C code , only add annotations
5. Make sure to describe your thought process behind the
annotations
6. Do not skip any code in the returned solution to make
it shorter .
